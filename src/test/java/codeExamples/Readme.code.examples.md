## code.examples package

The purpose of the code.examples package is for me to try out elements of the language
and frameworks in a safe place and leave them as examples for me to use in
the actual tests.

These are not intended to be run as real tests.

If this were a real system, I'd probably use JUnit tagging to ignore them.
